## Design

## Service microservice

I'm going to create a Technician Model. The properties will include a name and employee number(unique?).
A Service Appointment Model. The properties will include a VIN(has to be unique), customer name, the date and time of appointment, reason for the appointment, and the technician as a Foreign Key. I'll also need to include some form of finished property as a boolean value. Shown in the picture example for when an appointment is finished.
I will also need create an AutomobileVO model to poll from the Inventory Automobile model, using the VIN, import_href.
